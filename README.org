#+TITLE: homebrew-taps

[[https://brew.sh/][Hombrew]] is the "Missing package manager for macOS". It lets you
install, update, and version packages all through the command
line. Some of the software I write is avaliable through homebrew. You
can add the ability to install it by typing =brew tap
jakevossen5/taps= in your terminal. Then install software by using
=brew install=. For example: =brew install omnifocus-graph-creator=.
